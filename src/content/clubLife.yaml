- Title: Mentorship
  Content: !markdown |
    Here at amFOSS, seniors guide juniors on their way in the club. It is a learning and development partnership between someone with vast experience and someone who wants to learn. Mentoring others is one of the most important parts of being in a community - an experience and a skill which is difficult to gain in a typical classroom scenario. Mentors are responsible for tracking their progress, ensuring that they are doing what is best suited for them.

- Title: Social Commitments
  Content: !markdown |
    Being part of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham (under the Mata Amritanandamayi Math, an NGO with Special Consultative Status to the UN) we get valuable opportunities to lend hands in noble causes in times of dire adversities. During the Kerala floods (2018) which shook the entire state, Amrita University under the guidance of Mata Amritanandamayi set up a 24x7 Hour helpline for providing victim relief. Our students were able to lend a hand in the noble cause, along with the entire college, running shifts day in and day out. Under the ABC (Amala Bharatam Campaign) program by MAM, our students had the opportunity to serve as part of a Clean Up drive conducted in the nearby area.
