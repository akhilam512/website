Initially, the students were not really confident of getting selected let alone winning.\nHowever, they were highly motivated and enthusiastic about it. While at the same time, Vipin was however,\nvery confident in his students, and having prior experience in software development was certain\nthat his students would come on top.</p>\n<p>Months went past, with them working day and night under intense preparation focusing only their goal.\nThey missed out on academics and the usual college life, and were often mocked by their classmates.\nInfact, there were instances when nothing went there way and they thought of giving up, but however\nwere pushed forward by Vipin.</p>\n<p>In the end, they ended up among the Top 5 teams from India, and were invited to Mumbai for the\nprize distribution ceremony. This was the first national level prize to be won by Amritapuri students.</p>\n","Quote":"“This was a great confidence booster for not only them but also inspired other students who now thought they too can, if they try.

Avinash who had just completed his course on Operating System was now expected to\ncontribute to one with over 9 million lines of code.</p>\n<p>After two months of intense effort Avinash finally figured out how to contribute, and started contributing\nto it. He also wrote documentation of the whole process, so that his peers could also get started with it.\nSoon many students started contributing to it.</p>\n<p>Every day students would stayback in the lab till late and work on making contributions to various open source\nsoftware from Sun. On the last day of the contest, i.e. 14th February, special permission was granted for the\ngirls too to stayback in the lab till midnight.</p>\n<p>When the contest was judged, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham emerged as the champion university, with 105\ncontributions.
